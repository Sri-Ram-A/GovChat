run backend like this.
```bash
python manage.py runserver_plus --cert-file ../localhost+3.pem --key-file ../localhost+3-key.pem 0.0.0.0:8000
```
frontend is as usual


my ip address was 192.168.1.6 , what you must do is get your pc ip addr then replace all those with yours

192.168.1.3

why certificate is that we need location access and you can use https 
first use postman or createsuperuser then create sample domain , juridiction , department only one ; remaining is automated

npm install ogl
